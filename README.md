My Personal Website
> This repo is a clone of [Brittant Chiang's personal website](https://github.com/bchiang7/v3), but it's not a fork. Iâ€™ve tried to write it myself using Next.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
